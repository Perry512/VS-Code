            The first presentation in the AIA/StarWatch Winter 2021 Lecture Series presented by Dr. Melanie
            Hubbard, Associate Professor of Anthropology at Wright State University. </br>

            The Middle Woodland Period (200 BCE - 700 CE) in the Midwestern United States is best known for the
            Hopewell. However, west-central Indiana does not fit that definition well. Surrounded by Hopewell
            culture, yet perhaps not fully of it, the Northwood site of west-central Indiana was the focus of Indiana
            University's archaeological field school. Survey and excavation have revealed a village surrounding a
            plaza. The plant remains from the site give clues to the lifeways of this little-understood area. Food
            choices are constrained by the environment and at the same time, strongly shaped by culture. The plants
            used by the inhabitants of the Northwoods site were a mixture of wild and domesticated. Few of these
            plants are widely used today, and several types represent the “lost crops” of the Eastern Agricultural
            Complex.
