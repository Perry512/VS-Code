            Amateurs had found some prehistoric materials at the site in the 1960s. Professional excavation began
            in 1972 as a salvage operation when the city planned a sewage treatment plant. With the discovery of
            significant artifacts and the remains of a stockaded village, the city changed its plans to preserve the site.
            Excavations continued through 1988 and are generally completed, although additional small studies
            have been done. The studies have revealed much about the original people's dwellings, social
            organization, diets, burial practices and other aspects of their lives at the site. The circular village,
            surrounded by defensive palisades, was occupied for about 25 years, with a total population of about
            300. They depended on farming and hunting.

            Scholars have named it Star Watch because, since studies of the 1980s, they believe that a
            complex of posts in the plaza related to astronomical measurements. The Fort Ancient culture
            people, whose society was based on agriculture, would have planned rituals around a solar
            calendar.

            With reconstructed dwellings, a plaza and gardens, and an interpretive center, the village was
            opened in 1987 to the public as an open-air museum. Interpretive tours are offered as well as a
            variety of educational programs and special events developed in collaboration with Native
            American and other groups. Archaeological excavations are ongoing in the area, with special
            opportunities for school groups, graduate students, and adult learners.

            Additional artifacts and exhibits are held in the related Boorshaft Museum of Discovery in
            Dayton. These help interpret the history and culture of the people, and show more of the
            artifacts recovered at the site than can be displayed at StarWatch.
